"In this video, we're going to be creating the popular Todoist list application (https://todoist.com) from scratch using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (unit & integration testing). 
Besides the latter technologies, we will style the application using SCSS (CSS) and following the BEM naming methodology. 
I will also make sure that this application is fully responsive. In this video I'll also show you how to use Lighthouse (Chrome extension) to make sure your website is fully accessible by getting all accessibility features integrated into our application; this is hugely important!
We will start by initialising the application using create-react-app as our base, and then build out the application using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (unit & integration testing)! I'm super excited to build this React application (did I mention we will be adding dark mode?!), so let's get going! "
